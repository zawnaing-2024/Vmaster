# Before vs After Enabling RADIUS

## 📊 What Happened with Your SSTP Account

### Your Existing Account:
```
Username: vpn_05c41373
Password: G#za2cJiVa6zX7Aw
Server ID: 2 (SSTP Server)
```

**Status:**
- ✅ Exists in VMaster database (vpn_accounts table)
- ❌ Does NOT exist in RADIUS database
- ⚠️ Why? Because RADIUS was DISABLED when you created it

---

## 🔄 Before RADIUS Enabled (Old Way)

### When you created the SSTP account:

```
1. Customer clicks "Create VPN Account"
   ↓
2. VMaster generates username/password
   ↓
3. VMaster stores ONLY in vpn_accounts table
   ↓
4. Shows credentials to customer
   ↓
5. Customer shares with client
   ↓
6. Client tries to connect
   ↓
7. ❌ Connection FAILS (no account on SSTP server)
   ↓
8. ⚠️ Admin must MANUALLY create account on SSTP server
```

**Problem:** Manual work required!

---

## ✅ After RADIUS Enabled (New Way)

### When you create NEW SSTP accounts:

```
1. Customer clicks "Create VPN Account"
   ↓
2. VMaster generates username/password
   ↓
3. VMaster creates user in RADIUS database (radcheck table)
   ↓
4. VMaster stores in vpn_accounts table (for display)
   ↓
5. Shows credentials to customer
   ↓
6. Customer shares with client
   ↓
7. Client tries to connect
   ↓
8. SSTP server asks RADIUS: "Is user valid?"
   ↓
9. RADIUS checks radcheck table
   ↓
10. RADIUS responds: "YES, allow"
    ↓
11. ✅ Connection SUCCESS (automatic!)
```

**Benefit:** Zero manual work!

## 🎯 What To Do Now

### Option 1: Add Existing Account to RADIUS (Recommended)

Run this command to add your existing account to RADIUS:

```bash
docker exec vpn_cms_db mysql -uroot -prootpassword radius -e \
  "INSERT INTO radcheck (username, attribute, op, value) \
   VALUES ('vpn_05c41373', 'Cleartext-Password', ':=', 'G#za2cJiVa6zX7Aw')"
```

Then verify:
```bash
docker exec vpn_cms_db mysql -uroot -prootpassword radius -e \
  "SELECT * FROM radcheck"
```

**Result:** Your existing account will now work with RADIUS!

---

### Option 2: Delete and Recreate (Clean Start)

1. **Delete the old account** (in VMaster customer portal)
2. **Create a new SSTP account** (will automatically add to RADIUS)
3. **Get new credentials** (will be different)

**Result:** Fresh account that's properly in RADIUS from the start!

---

## 📋 Check Both Databases

### VMaster Database (For Display):
```bash
docker exec vpn_cms_db mysql -uroot -prootpassword vpn_cms_portal -e \
  "SELECT id, account_username, account_password, server_id 
   FROM vpn_accounts 
   WHERE server_id IN (SELECT id FROM vpn_servers WHERE server_type='sstp')"
```

Shows: All SSTP accounts VMaster knows about

---

### RADIUS Database (For Authentication):
```bash
docker exec vpn_cms_db mysql -uroot -prootpassword radius -e \
  "SELECT id, username, value as password FROM radcheck"
```

Shows: Users that can actually authenticate via RADIUS

---

## 🔍 Understanding the Two Databases

### VMaster Database (vpn_cms_portal.vpn_accounts):
**Purpose:** Tracking and display
- Stores all VPN account info
- Used to show customers their accounts
- Used for billing, stats, management
- VMaster's "address book" of accounts

### RADIUS Database (radius.radcheck):
**Purpose:** Authentication
- Stores only username + password
- Used by SSTP server to validate connections
- The "bouncer's guest list"
- Only accounts here can connect!

---

## 🎯 The Key Rule

```
VMaster DB + RADIUS DB = Working SSTP with automation

VMaster DB only = Manual account creation needed

RADIUS DB only = Authentication works, but VMaster can't display/manage
```

**Both databases should have the same users!**

---

## ✅ Test the Difference

### Test 1: Create New Account (RADIUS Enabled)

1. Login as customer
2. Create new SSTP VPN account
3. Check both databases:

**VMaster DB:**
```bash
docker exec vpn_cms_db mysql -uroot -prootpassword vpn_cms_portal -e \
  "SELECT account_username FROM vpn_accounts ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1"
```

**RADIUS DB:**
```bash
docker exec vpn_cms_db mysql -uroot -prootpassword radius -e \
  "SELECT username FROM radcheck ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1"
```

**Result:** Same username in BOTH! ✅

---

### Test 2: Sync Existing Accounts

If you have multiple old accounts, sync them all:

```bash
# Get all SSTP accounts from VMaster
docker exec vpn_cms_db mysql -uroot -prootpassword vpn_cms_portal -e \
  "SELECT account_username, account_password FROM vpn_accounts 
   WHERE server_id IN (SELECT id FROM vpn_servers WHERE server_type='sstp')" \
  > sstp_accounts.txt

# Then add each to RADIUS
# (Manual for each account, or use a script)
```

---

## 🚀 Going Forward

### New SSTP Accounts:
✅ Automatically added to RADIUS  
✅ Automatically added to VMaster  
✅ Ready to use immediately  
✅ Zero manual work  

### Existing Old Accounts:
⚠️ Need manual sync to RADIUS  
✅ Use Option 1 (add to RADIUS) or Option 2 (recreate)
